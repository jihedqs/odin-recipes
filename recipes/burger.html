    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      No more dry, lackluster hamburgers. These are juicy, and spices can be
      easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. If you find the meat
      mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that
      hold their shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      This aptly named hamburger recipe uses evaporated milk, eggs, and bread
      crumbs to create incredibly juicy and flavorful hamburger patties that
      will rival your favorite burger joint.
